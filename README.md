# mupalavra

An educational game based on the famous Wordle that I'm building for the Museu Paranaense, a museum in my hometown in Brazil. I wanted the game to present the user with words of different lengths, based on the museum collection. 
I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build it. 
The next step is to add a simple paragraph telling a little bit about the word.
