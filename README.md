This is an educational project being developed for the Paranaense Museum in Brazil. It's based on the famous Wordle game. 

The project is based on FreeCodeCamp tutorial. I tweaked a few things. First, I wanted to be able to choose words with different lengths, not only 5-letter words as the original project. I also modified the layout. I entered words related to the museum collection and exhibitions. 

I'm working a database so that the museum researchers will be able to enter more words.

# What I have learned

With this project I learned more ways to interact with the DOM using JavaScript. 

# What issues have I faced and how I resolved them

When deploying the project on GitHub, I couldn't make it work. The problem was that the original tutorial uses the folder "build" and I found out that I had to change it to "docs" to make it work.
