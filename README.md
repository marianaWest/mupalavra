An educational game based on the famous Wordle that I'm building for Museu Paranaense, a museum in Brazil. I wanted the game to present the user with words of different lengths, based on the museum collection. 

I'm using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build it. 

The next step is to add a simple paragraph telling a little bit about the word.
