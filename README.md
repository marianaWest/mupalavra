## Description
This is an educational project for the Paranaense Museum in Brazil. It's based on the famous Wordle game. 

This project is based on a tutorial on FreeCodeCamp. I tweaked a few things. First, I wanted to be able to choose words with different lengths, not only 5-letter words as the original project. I also modified the layout. I entered words related to the museum collection and exhibitions. 

The next step will be to create a database so that the museum researchers will be able to enter more words. Also, I want to include a brief explanation of the word after the player guesses it. 

## Tech
The project uses the CSS library Animate and JavaScript library Toastr.
