This is an educational project being developed for the Paranaense Museum in Brazil. It's based on the famous Wordle game. 

The project is based on FreeCodeCamp tutorial. I tweaked a few things. First, I wanted to be able to choose words with different lengths, not only 5-letter words as the original project. I also modified the layout. I entered words related to the museum collection and exhibitions. 

I'm working a database so that the museum researchers will be able to enter more words.

# What I have learned

[Tell more about what you have learned while building this project]

**Example:**

While I was building {YOUR_PROJECT_NAME} I have learned the fundamentals of React and Redux. I learned what is the difference between React Context API and Redux, and what works best for my current application. I have used Reat hooks like useEffect, useState. It was my first project using TypeScript and I have learned a lot about TypeScript type definitions and fundamentals.

# What issues have I faced and how I resolved them

[Tell what was hard in the process of building the project. Tell about where have you feel stuck and how did you overcome this.]

**Example:**

When I tried to connect to the third-party API, I was not sure how to use fetch and what is the difference between async/await, what are Promises and how to use them. After some Googling I found out the MDN documentation about async/await and tried to use it in practice - it worked!
